#Understanding Yulu and the Problem
• What is Yulu? It’s an Indian company providing small, electric bikes for short commutes.
Think of it like a bike-sharing service where you rent a bike for a short trip.
• Yulu’s Goal: To make getting around cities easier, especially the first and last parts of a
trip between your home and public transportation.
• The Problem: Yulu’s income has been going down. They want to know why fewer people
are using their bikes.
The Consulting Project
• Aim: To figure out what makes people more or less likely to rent a Yulu bike.
• Data: The consultants have a bunch of data:
– When bikes were rented
– The weather that day (temperature, rain, etc.)
– Whether it was a holiday or workday
– How many casual users vs. regular members rented bikes
